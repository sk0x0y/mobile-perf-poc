# Progress: Mobile Performance POC

## What Works

- Initial project scaffolding for React Native Expo with PNPM is complete.
- ESLint and Prettier are configured for the React Native project.
- Path aliases and Barrel Pattern structure are implemented in the React Native project.
- Basic Expo Router navigation with tabs is set up in the React Native project.
- Placeholder files for most components, hooks, utilities, services, and list test screens are created in the React Native project.
- Type definitions for the feed data have been initially created and partially refined.
- Performance test plan and PRD documents (`docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PRD-gaps.md`) have been completed.
- **React Native project structure refactored**: Non-routing code moved from `app/` to `src/` to resolve Expo Router warnings.
- **`PerformanceMonitor` import issue resolved**: Corrected the import mechanism for `PerformanceMonitor` in `app/_layout.tsx`.
- **Package version compatibility addressed**: Downgraded `@shopify/flash-list`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, and `react-native-pager-view` to compatible versions.
- **`app.json` warnings resolved**: `scheme` added to `app.json` for linking, and `newArchEnabled` was confirmed to be correctly set.
- **All comments removed from `.ts`, `.tsx`, and `.js` files within the `react-native` directory.**
- **Path alias `@types` renamed to `@typedefs`**: Configuration files (`tsconfig.json`, `babel.config.js`) updated. No code changes were required as direct imports using `@types/` prefix were not found.
- **List rendering test basic structure unified**: `sectionlist.tsx` and `virtualized.tsx` were modified to use `AutomatedFeedTest`.
- **FastImage integration**: `FeedItem.tsx` was updated to use `FastImage` for image loading.
- **`react-native-performance` related TypeScript issues resolved**: `performance.ts` was updated to extend `PerformanceEntry` type and cast `entryType`.
- **`any` type replacement**: `feed.ts` was updated with more specific interfaces instead of `any`.
- **`generateTestData` function implemented**: `data-generator.ts` now includes the `generateTestData` function.
- **FullScreenFeedPager for each list type implemented**: `AutomatedFeedTest` now conditionally renders FlatList, FlashList, SectionList, and VirtualizedList based on `testName`.
- **Detailed performance metrics collection implemented**: Memory usage measurement using a dummy implementation in `performance.ts` and integrated into `usePerformanceMetrics` hook.
- **Performance measurement results screen implemented**: `app/(tabs)/metrics.tsx` now displays collected performance data.
- **Test automation script implemented**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` now includes buttons to trigger automated tests using `AutomatedFeedTest`.

## What's Left to Build

- Full implementation of performance measurement metrics logic in both React Native and Flutter applications. (Note: Memory usage is currently a dummy implementation in RN).
- Complete development of list rendering test screens in both frameworks to load and display data from `docs/data.json`.
- Implementation and testing of various list rendering optimization techniques in both frameworks.
- Refinement of type definitions based on a comprehensive analysis of `docs/data.json`.
- Implementation of utility functions (data generation, formatting, validation) in both frameworks.
- Implementation of service functions (API, storage) in both frameworks.
- Integration of performance metrics display in the UI for both applications.
- Addressing the peer dependency warning for `react-native-fast-image` in the React Native project.
- Setting up and running automated performance tests for both frameworks.
- Analyzing performance test results and documenting findings in `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- Preparing a report comparing the performance of React Native and Flutter based on the test results.

## Current Status

The React Native project's foundational structure and configuration are now largely complete, with major setup and warning issues resolved. The core functionality for performance measurement and list rendering tests is now implemented, with a dummy memory measurement for the managed workflow.

## Known Issues

- TypeScript errors related to `react-native-performance` persist and are currently suppressed with `@ts-ignore`.
- The terminal output in the environment details is not updating reliably, making it difficult to confirm successful bundling and app launch.
- A peer dependency warning exists for `react-native-fast-image` and React version 19.
- **`expo-router` default export warning**: `WARN Route "./(tabs)/index.tsx" is missing the required default export.` This warning persists despite verifying the `index.tsx` and `_layout.tsx` files. It is currently considered a non-blocking issue, possibly related to Expo's internal caching or `expo-router` version.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initially planned to use relative paths for imports, but switched to path aliases and Barrel Pattern for better code organization and maintainability.
- Decided to use PNPM as the package manager based on user request and its benefits for monorepos and efficient dependency management.
- Chose Expo Router for navigation due to its file-based approach and ease of use with Expo.
- Opted for a Google style base for ESLint due to its comprehensiveness and widespread adoption, combined with React Native specific rules for mobile development best practices.
- Decided to compare React Native and Flutter performance to inform the technical stack decision.
- Completed the performance test plan and PRD documents based on the project goals and requirements.
- Encountered and temporarily worked around TypeScript issues with `react-native-performance` due to lack of immediate access to specific documentation via the MCP tool.
- **Adopted a clear separation of routing (`app/`) and non-routing (`src/`) code** to adhere to best practices and resolve Expo Router warnings.
- **Prioritized resolving package version conflicts** to ensure project stability and compatibility.
- **Implemented dummy memory measurement**: Due to limitations of `react-native-device-info` in Expo's managed workflow, a dummy implementation was used for memory usage measurement to allow continued development.
